    <p>
      My name is Kees van Voorthuizen â€” I'm a 17-years-old Dutch full stack developer
      and CTO & Co-Founder of <a href="https://tribecamp.com">Tribecamp</a>. I'm a huge
      fan of modern web frameworks, and I like learning new things. I have 4-5 years of
      experience with C#.NET, but nowadays I'm mainly into web development and creating
      scalable backends with Node.js and TypeScript.
    </p>

    <p>
      I absolutely love working with GNU/Linux environments. I'm using Artix Linux with the
      <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">bspwm</a> window manager at the moment
      and I've dealt with Debian, Ubuntu, Arch, Manjaro and Mint in the past. Vim and Visual
      Studio Code are my preferred text editors.
    </p>

    <p>
      My first ever experience with Linux was around the age of ten. At the time I got an
      old computer with an empty hard disk from my aunt, on which I then installed Ubuntu
      with LXDE on the advice of an acquaintance. I have become addicted to computers,
      programming and tech ever since.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my future goals is to learn and fully understand the C language (and C++).
      I'm also very interested in the Rust language and I'm quite familiar with Java and
      Python.
